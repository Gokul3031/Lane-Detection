# Finding Lane Lines on the Road

The objectives of this project are as follows:

Develop a pipeline for detecting lane lines on the road.
Reflect on the project's implementation in a written report.

### Reflection
1. Pipeline Description:

#### Current Pipeline:

### Masking Unnecessary Colors:

We filter out unnecessary colors and noise using the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) colorspace to isolate white and yellow lane markings. This reduces the impact of noise, shadows, and sunlight.
Region of Interest (ROI) Masking:

We isolate the lane lines by masking out everything outside a predefined region of interest (ROI) represented as a polygon.

### Edge Detection:

We compute the edges of the images using Canny Edge Detection, converting the input image to grayscale and then detecting the gradient (rate of change) of adjacent pixels.

### Finding Lines:

Lane lines are determined from the Canny edges using the Hough Transform. We filter the lines based on slope and zone, then group them into corresponding lanes based on their slope. We calculate the average slope and intercept for each lane, and apply interframe averaging for stability in video streams.

### Overlaying the Image and the Lines:

Finally, we overlay the detected lane lines onto the original input image using a weighted sum.

2. Procedure:

### Getting the Images:

Read images from the specified directory and store them in the imageList list.

### Masking Unnecessary Colors:

Use HSL colorspace to filter out white and yellow lane markings, combining the masks to isolate the lane lines.

### Region of Interest (ROI) Masking:

Define a region of interest (ROI) polygon and mask out everything outside this region.

### Edge Detection:

Convert the image to grayscale and apply Canny Edge Detection to compute the edges of the image.

### Finding Lines:

Use the Hough Transform to detect lines from the Canny edges, filter and group them into corresponding lanes, and compute the average slope and intercept for each lane.

### Overlaying the Image and the Lines:

Overlay the detected lane lines onto the original input image using a weighted sum.

3. Potential Shortcomings:

The pipeline works well for straight or slightly curved lanes but may struggle with sharp turns or highly curved roads.
The method may not generalize well to different road conditions or environments.
It does not account for vehicle detection or adjacent lanes, limiting its ability to localize the car accurately.

4. Possible Improvements:

Implement a sliding window algorithm to detect curved lanes more accurately.
Incorporate vehicle detection and lane tracking algorithms to improve localization.
Experiment with different colorspaces and thresholding techniques for robustness to varying road conditions.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the current pipeline demonstrates effective lane detection capabilities but has limitations in handling curved lanes and complex road environments. By implementing suggested improvements and exploring advanced techniques, the pipeline can be further enhanced for more robust and accurate lane detection in real-world scenarios.
